# SugarCube2-Hotlink

SugarCube v2.12.1 Hosted for Hotlinking in Twine 2 Browser App

The current version of the Twine browser app doesn't allow for installing SugarCube 2 from a file URL on the HD. This is the latest version of SugarCube, hosted online for hotlinking in UIC's Game Play class.  

## Instructions

This applies to the browser app only! The local/offline Twine 2 app works fine with files on your HD. The upcoming Twine 2.1 release should (hopefully!) make this repository obsolete.
